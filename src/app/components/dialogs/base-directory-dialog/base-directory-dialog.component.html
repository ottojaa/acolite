  <h3>Choose a workspace directory</h3>
  <p>
    Workspace directory will be the folder where all of your files created in this application go. You can choose an
    existing folder, create a new one, or let the application create one for you. Options are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set default directory: creates an empty folder in <span style="font-style: italic">documents/Acolite</span></li>
    <li>Choose directory: select the desired destination, or create a new one.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Change workspace on the go</h3>
  <p>
    Changing your workspace is easy and you can do it anytime. All of your files will still be there, and all of the
    workspaces will be backed up separately.
  </p>
  <p>Your workspace settings are automatically saved.</p>
